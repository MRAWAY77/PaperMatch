# 📚 PaperMatch

**PaperMatch** is an AI-powered platform designed to help researchers seamlessly navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of academic research and its surrounding media narratives.

With the exponential growth in scholarly publications and the fragmentation of information across platforms, it has become increasingly challenging for academics to stay updated with cutting-edge research **and** understand the broader societal and media context. PaperMatch solves this by unifying academic discovery and media analysis in a single platform.

## 🔍 Why PaperMatch?

Studies have highlighted the challenges of information overload and disjointed research dissemination (Bawden & Robinson, 2009; Tenopir et al., 2012), while media theorists underscore the impact of framing and narratives on public and academic perceptions (Entman, 1993). PaperMatch tackles both issues by:

- Streamlining literature discovery  
- Summarizing dense academic texts  
- Analyzing relevant media coverage  
- Offering contextualized, actionable insights
